Welcome to my collection of C programming projects! This repository includes a series of simple yet impactful programs written in the C programming language. These programs cover a wide range of fundamental concepts, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and more. Each program is designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task, and they serve as a great way to demonstrate my growing knowledge of C.

## **Programs Included**

### **1. Addition of Two Numbers**

**Description**: A simple program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum. 

**Concepts Covered**: Binary Addition, Bitwise Operations, Logic Gates

### **2. BMI Calculator**

**Description**: A program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input (height and weight).

**Concepts Covered**: User Input, Mathematical Operations, Conditionals

### **3. Calculating Power of a Number**

**Description**: A program to calculate the power of a number (e.g., a^b).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Exponentiation

### **4. Checking for Armstrong Number**

**Description**: A program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Conditionals, Mathematical Calculations

### **5. Checking for Strong Number**

**Description**: A program that checks if a given number is a Strong number (a number that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Factorial Calculation, Conditionals

### **6. Checking for Leap Year**

**Description**: A program to check if a given year is a leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless divisible by 400).

**Concepts Covered**: Conditionals, Modulus Operator

### **7. Palindrome Number Check**

**Description**: A program that checks if a given number is a palindrome (a number that reads the same backward as forward).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Conditionals, Reversing Numbers

### **8. Perfect Number Check**

**Description**: A program that checks if a number is a perfect number (a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Divisibility, Conditionals

### **9. Prime Number Check**

**Description**: A program to check if a given number is prime (a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Conditionals, Prime Checking

### **10. Converting Binary to Decimal**

**Description**: A program to convert a binary number into its decimal equivalent.

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Number System Conversion

### **11. Factorial of a Number**

**Description**: A program to calculate the factorial of a given number (n!).

**Concepts Covered**: Recursion, Factorial Calculation

### **12. Fibonacci Series**

**Description**: A program to print the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Recursion, Series Generation

### **13. Floyd's Triangle**

**Description**: A program that generates Floyd's Triangle (a right-angle triangle where the numbers are arranged in increasing order).

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Number Patterns

### **14. HCF of Two Numbers**

**Description**: A program to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers.

**Concepts Covered**: Euclidean Algorithm, Loops, Mathematical Operations

### **15. Reversing a Number**

**Description**: A program that reverses a given number.

**Concepts Covered**: Loops, Reversing Numbers

### **16. Temperature Converter**

**Description**: A program that converts a given temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

**Concepts Covered**: User Input, Arithmetic Operations

### **17. Reverse the Elements of an Array**

**Description**: This program takes an array as input, and then outputs the elements of the array in both the original and reversed order.

**Concepts Covered**: Array, Looping, Input/Output, Array Manipulation
